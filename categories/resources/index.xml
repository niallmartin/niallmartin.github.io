      <description>Getting started in data science can be a daunting task. The area is broad, with little guidance on where one topic start and the next ends. Because of that, I&#39;ve pulled together this list of resources that particularly helped me when I was starting out.
I&#39;ve broken the links into the following four categories, each of which distinguishes between the different skills required data scientists:

      <description>I’m a data scientist from Ireland, with a doctorate in Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge. During my PhD, I specialised in the development of machine learning models to determine how vehicle manufacturers cheated fuel consumption standards. I’m also a Fellow of the Insight Data Science program in Palo Alto, and work in Google’s Trust &amp;amp; Safety team in Dublin.
Beyond my academic experiences, I enjoy skiing, cycling , and reading non-fiction.</description>
