      <description>Machine Learning Notebook I have a terrible memory. But thing that I find particularly helpful when trying to remember conepts is an ongoing journal of terms. I&#39;ve traditionally use a moleskin for this task, but have decided to switch to using this blog.
In that spirit, what follows is a live, ever evolving list of ML concepts, links and papers.
Optimisers Term used to describe algorithms that minimise (or maximise) the objective function.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated&amp;rdquo; ~ Confucius
Simple is harder than complex. And this&#39;s particularly true of academic research and ML models. I&#39;m always on the lookout for resources that aim to simply describe statistical concepts and machine learning in an simple manner. Those who can do so truly understand the topic.
Here&#39;s an ongoign list of blogs and resources that I love the most.</description>

      <title>Introductory Resources for Data Science</title>

      <description>Getting started in data science can be a daunting task. The area is broad, with little guidance on where one topic start and the next ends. Because of that, I&#39;ve pulled together this list of resources that particularly helped me when I was starting out.
I&#39;ve broken the links into the following four categories, each of which distinguishes between the different skills required by data scientists:
 Data Analytics - Involves feature engineering and statistical tests.</description>
